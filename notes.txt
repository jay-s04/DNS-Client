Fields in the query I should be aware of:
TC TrunCation - specifies that this message was truncated. For this project, you must exit and return
an error if you receive a response that is truncated

RD Recursion Desired - this bit directs the name server to pursue the query recursively. You should
use 1, representing that you desire recursion, for Part A and Part B. For Part C this should be set
to 0.

RA Recursion Available - this bit is set or cleared in a response, and denotes whether recursive
query support is available in the name server. Recursive query support is optional. You
must exit and return an error if you receive a response that indicates the server does not support
recursion for Part A and Part B.
